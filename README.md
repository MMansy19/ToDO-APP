# React - TodoList


This is a simple todo application built with React.js. It allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, drag the task, sort the tasks, and change the theme from light to dark.

This is a solution to the [Todo app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW).

## Features

- Create new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Deleting tasks
- Filter tasks by status (All, Active, Completed)
- Change the order of tasks using drag and drop
- Change themes: light dark

## What I learned

In this project I honed my React.js skills, began to master the Tailwind framework, and worked with the interesting Frame Motion library.

### Continued development

I plan to continue mastering React; itâ€™s also interesting to get to grips with TypeScript, and reach a new level of application creation.
